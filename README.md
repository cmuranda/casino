# casino

* This project works best with java version 19.

* I did add an extra path /player/add for adding a player and the path returns the player id.

* There is an added configuration class that adds two new players; username: charles, id:1 and username: john, id 2.
The configuration also initializes 3 transactions for the first player (username: charles)
